### React Web Page Firebase Authentication With MUI

I created a simple web page with Firebase authentication and Material UI. I tried to prevent my passwords from being exposed by keeping the firebase keys in the <b>.env</b> file. With the useContext structure, I accessed the firebase functions on each page and provided the authorization control with Private Routers.
