### React Web Page Firebase Authentication With MUI

I created a simple web page with Firebase authentication and Material UI.I used Card structure, Grid structure and Typographies with MUI. It is easier to make it responsive when the Grid is used, that's why I chose it. I also modified one of the Appbars to create the navbar. I tried to prevent my passwords from being exposed by keeping the firebase keys in the <b>.env</b> file. With the useContext structure, I accessed the firebase functions on each page and provided the authorization control with Private Routers.
